# GAN-Monet-Colorado-Assignment
This project focuses on implementing the **CycleGAN** model for unpaired image-to-image translation, specifically transforming Monet paintings into real-life photos and vice versa. Using two generators and two discriminators, the model learns to convert between these two domains without the need for paired datasets. The goal is to enable seamless style transfer between artistic and realistic images, which can be applied to fields like digital art, image editing, and computer vision research.
